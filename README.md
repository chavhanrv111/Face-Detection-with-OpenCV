                                                # Face-Detection-with-OpenCV
                                                
We will see how to perform whole face detection, eye detection and smile detection from images There are various algorithms that have been developed for face recognition tasks. Viola-Jones algorithm. It is a very simple algorithm and can detect objects such as faces in images with very high accuracy

### Computer Vision :
- It is an inter disciplinary scientific field that deals with how computer can gain high level understanding from digital images or videos.
- Computer vision is referred to as a field of study that comprises techniques and methodologies used to capture, analyse and process images and videos and take decisions based on information extracted from images or videos

## libraries :
- matplotlib
  - pyplot
- numpy
- cv2
- PIL
  - Image
